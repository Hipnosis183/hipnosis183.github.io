**MEAN Full Stack** web application, consisting of a **Node.js Backend API** with **Express**, a **MongoDB** database and an **AngularJS + Material Frontend**.

<br />

Software developer final career project. There were no requirements, so I took the liberty to adapt the final project of the **Projects Management** assignemnt to a real software product, in web application form.

<br />

The app has been developed in two different ways:

<br />

1. ```salne-server``` consists of a **Node.js** server with **Express**, rendering the views server-side, together with **Nunjucks** as the template engine.

2. ```salne-backend``` it's an **API** server with **Node.js** and **Express**, and ```salne-frontend``` it's a client with **AngularJS** and **Material** that communicates with the API, separating the bussiness logic from the user interface.
