**Instagular** is a custom web client for Instagram, aiming for a better desktop experience, unlike the mobile-on-web design that the official site has, while adding extra features not found on regular Instagram.

<br />

This project implements its own backend API server using a custom fork of [instagram-private-api](https://github.com/Hipnosis183/instagram-private-api) to connect/interface to Instagram, acting as a middleware between the Instagular client and the Instagram server.

<br />

## Implemented features

- Login/logout with persistent session on local storage.
- Feeds with auto pagination management.
- Fullscreen media viewer, with high quality photos and videos play.
- Profile user pages (posts, reels, videos, tagged).
- Stories/highlights support.
- User interaction (like/unlike, follow/unfollow, comments).
- High/original quality media download.
- Saved collections management.
- Users search engine.
