    <p>
      Low-level lover in an high-level society.
      <br><br>
      Software developer professionally (the degree says so), graphic designer by hobby.
      Currently doing web stuff.
      <br><br>
      I like to analize and write about stuff i've done or am doing at the moment.<br>
      Kinda pointless and stupid sometimes, but interesting (i guess).

      While the photo is a bit outdated (and it can't be appreciated anyways),
      now I have grown a beard and left my hair long.
      Maybe one day I'll go back to that nice surfer look.
