**JM-Server** is a server emulator for **Jewelry Master**, an online arcade puzzle game developed by **Arika** in 2006. This project served as a gameplay test for the next game in the series, **Jewelry Master Twinkle**. The original service ceased operations around 2011, and since then it remained unplayable, until now.

<br />

The server functionality has been fully reverse engineered and reimplemented in two different ways:

<br />

- A **NodeJS server**, mimicking how the original server worked, where people can connect to from the client over the internet.
- An **embedded C server**, as a portable solution that doesn't require any external server nor database initialization, while maintaining the full functionality and behaviour of the original.

<br />

Both implement complete user and rankings/leaderboards management, including replays storage. In addition, some options are available to further customise the server behaviour.

<br />

## NodeJS Server
The **NodeJS** version is meant to be used for hosting servers over the internet, although it can still be used to connect and play locally. As it uses proper server tech and a robust database engine (**MongoDB**), it's more suitable to handle multiple connections and big amounts of data.

<br />

## C Server
The **C** solution is provided for local and portable use, where by just running the executable, it initializes a minimal **Mongoose** embedded server with a light and performant **LMDB** database, at the same time it hooks the networking functions of the game to redirect the internal API calls to this local server.
