    "TEXT": "I'm a professional <b>Full Stack</b> software developer with 6 years of experience, with a greater focus on frontend development and design. My current development stack is <b>NodeJS/Electron</b> + <b>MongoDB</b> + <b>Vue/Angular</b>, although I'm comfortable working with other JS/TS and CSS libraries/frameworks, such as <b>Astro</b> and <b>Tailwind</b>.<br /><br />Also, I'm a hobbyist graphic designer. While I started doing illustrations, these abilities have clearly been very influential in all of my software's UI/UX designs, plus my personal touch of, I believe, good taste.<br /><br />Whenever I'm not programming, I'm still programming, but not the usual, everyday web development. I've always been fascinated with the extensive diversity of fields in computer science, so every now and then I find myself doing other things, like <b>reverse engineering</b> and <b>low-level programming</b>, which not only gives me a good rest from centering containers and playing with colors, but also improves my overall skills in a way that otherwise wouldn't be possible. Also, hacking is what the cool kids do.<br /><br />Be sure to visit my <b><a href=\"/portfolio/\">portfolio</a></b> to see all my works, and the <b><a href=\"/blog/\">articles</a></b> page to read interesting things that I usually write from time to time."
