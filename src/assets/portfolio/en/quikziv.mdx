**QuikZIV** is an uncompressing tool for **ZIV** and **SQZ** files, using either **LZW** or **Huffman+RLE** compression. Developed to remove the protection of the CD-ROM version of **Quik The Thunder Rabbit**, it supports most (if not all) of **Titus Interactive** older games:

<br />

- Prehistorik
- Quik The Thunder Rabbit
- Super Cauldron
- Titus The Fox (and Moktar)
- The Blues Brothers (series)

<br />

Some games, like **Prehistorik 2**, have some files that are not supported, either because of a different compression method or an additional level of protection.
