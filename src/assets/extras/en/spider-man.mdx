This one is very simple, since the game doesn't use `MSCDEX`, we discard looking for a device check. Instead, the game is checking for the files being located at a specific path, `C:\SPIDER\`. The drive letter gets overwritten with the value in `SETUP.CFG`, but if we leave that empty, it defaults to `C:\` again. But to be able to run the game from any path, we simply empty the strings `\spider\` and `%c:` on the executable.

However, there's another problem. For some reason, the game deletes some of its own files, required to play the game. Whether this is intentional, as a security measure, or it's just a weird unexpected behaviour remains a mystery. To overcome this problem, setting the game folders and files as *read-only* prevents the issue.
