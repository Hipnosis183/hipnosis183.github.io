**Glaucous** is a **videogames database builder**, **library manager** and **emulator frontend**.
It allows you to create your own customized database, plus the ability to use it as a launcher/frontend.

<br />

The application and database are designed to be as dynamic as possible, giving you the freedom to choose what you want to see and how. **Customization** and **flexibility** are paramount, allowing you to adapt your current setup without forcing any specific changes to work.
