**NicolausiKey** is a key generator for the games **Nicolausi** and **PC-Bakterien** by **TOM Productions**, for both **DOS** and **Windows** versions.

<br />

The project contains three parts:

<br />

- A **C#** implementation of the keygen (both **Windows Forms** and **Console**)
- A **JavaScript** implementation of the keygen
- The original revised decompilation

<br />

For an in-depth analysis of the key generation algorithm, visit the [article](/blog/the-art-of-cracks-and-keygens-nicolausi/) on the blog section.
