**Viridian** is an **FFmpeg**-based, feature-rich **video editor**, offering a wide variety of both **lossless** and **lossy** operations. It allows you to easily manipulate video files without having to deal with the command line and FFmpeg's complexity, ensuring always the **best output quality possible**.

<br />

Viridian is also an excellent tool for advanced users, as it enables you to **manually edit** the final output command as you wish, without holding back any little nuances you might like to control.

<br />
